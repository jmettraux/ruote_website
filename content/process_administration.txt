h2. [business] process administration

The model of a business process usually focuses on a "happy path", everything happening according to the plan.

A few alternative paths may be added explicitely. Provisions for errors and timeouts may explicitely be added, thanks to "@:on_error@":common_attributes.html#on_error and "@:on_timeout@":common_attributes.html#on_timeout.

Sometimes, this is not enough. Processes may fall into errors, may stall (a participant reply got lost and there is no timeout) or they may simply become obsolete due to changes in their context.

Deciding whether an exception (error, timeout, ...) is dealt explicitely in the process definition often requires experience.

This page is about manipulating process instances.

h3(#query). querying the engine about running process instances

To list all the processes currently running in the engine ("rdoc":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/rdoc/Ruote/Engine.html#processes-instance_method):

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  statuses = engine.processes
</pre>

To query about a process, known by its @wfid@ (workflow instance id) ("rdoc":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/rdoc/Ruote/Engine.html#process-instance_method):

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  status = engine.process(wfid)
</pre>

Those two methods return "ProcessStatus":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/rdoc/Ruote/ProcessStatus.html instances.

***

h3(#cancelling). cancelling

Cancelling is about terminating the execution of a process instance or of a branch of it.

Cancelling cannot occur in one operation. The engine traverses the tree of execution and cancels alive expressions one by one. Active participants receive a cancel message indicating which the id of the workitem to cancel.

h4(#cancelling_process). cancelling: process instances

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.cancel_process(wfid)
</pre>

Warning: as explained cancelling a process or a branch of a process isn't instantaneous.

h4(#cancelling_expression). cancelling: expressions

Perhaps, the most common use case for "cancelling an expression" is cancelling a participant expression.

Let's say you have this process:

<div style="width: 100%; position: relative;">
<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition do
    sequence do
      logistics
      delivery
      accounting
    end
  end
</pre>
  <div style="position: absolute; top: -20px; right: 75px;">
    <img src="/images/cancelling_expression.png" width="100%"/>
  </div>
</div>

For some reason, this process was triggered for an online product, which was downloaded successfully. The delivery is not necessary, but the delivery participant has already received the workitem for this process instance.

Cancelling the delivery participant expression would let the flow continue to "accounting". Programmatically that would look like:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  status = engine.process(wfid)

  exp = status.expressions.first

  engine.cancel_expression(exp.fei)
</pre>

Warning: as explained cancelling a process or a branch of a process isn't instantaneous.


h4. Dashboard#cancel(wfid_or_fei)

The cancel method of the dashboard will, when passed a string, order the engine to cancel the process with the given (string) wfid (if it exists). When passed an expression, a FlowExpressionId instance or a Hash containing expid/subid/wfid, it will cancel the given expression (if it exists).

Likewise Dashboard#kill(wfid_or_fei) is as flexible as #cancel.


h4(#on_cancel). on_cancel

Most of the time, the process definition attempts to model the "happy path", the process as it occurs 95% of the time. One may want to go a step further and include provisions for errors (see "@on_error@":#on_error) and for cancellations.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition do
    sequence :on_cancel => 'admin' do
      logistics
      delivery
      accounting
    end
  end
</pre>

In this process definition, if the process or the sequence gets cancelled, the @admin@ subprocess (or the participant @admin@) will be applied (or simply receive a workitem).

More info about "@on_cancel@":common_attributes.html#on_cancel.


h4(#killing). killing vs cancelling

Processes (and expressions) can be cancelled or they can be killed. Killing looks much like cancelling, except that any "@on_cancel@":common_attributes.html#on_cancel will be ignored.

***

h3(#pausing_process). pausing process instance

Pausing a process instance is equivalent to pausing its root expression. Pausing freezes an expression (and all its children expressions that are in a running state (not in error, or being cancelled)).

A paused expression upon receiving a reply will store it and not process it until it gets resumed.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
dashboard.pause('20120618-makumepa')
  # will pause the corresponding process instance

# ...

dashboard.resume('20120618-makumepa')
  # will resume the corresponding process instance
</pre>

h3(#pausing_expression). pausing expressions

<pre class="brush: ruby">
dashboard.pause(fei)
  # will pause the expression (and its children) behind "fei"

# ...

dashboard.resume(fei)
  # will resume the expressionn (allow it to reply to its parent expression)
</pre>


h4. dashboard.pause(fei, :breakpoint => true)

By default, pausing pauses the target expression and all its children, if one wants to set a "breakpoint", ie let the flow resume but pause when it reaches back an expression, the breakpoint option can be used.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
dashboard.pause(fei, :breakpoint => true)
</pre>

Only the targetted expression will get paused, not its children. It means that the flow in the branch (the children of the expression) will go on, but once the flow gets back to the expression with the breakpoint, it will stop.

(Not sure if "breakpoint" is the best word for this, since we're not running a debugger, it's just a regular workflow run).

***

h3(#re_applying). re_applying

The "@Engine#re_apply(fei, options)@":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/rdoc/Ruote/Engine.html#method-i-re_apply method cancels an expression and re_applies. It has a few options for dealing with some process repair tasks.

Most of the technique described here are tested in ruote's "ft_14_re_apply.rb":http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/blob/ruote2.1/test/functional/ft_14_re_apply.rb


h4(#re_applying_stalled). re_applying a stalled [participant] expression

Sometimes participants don't reply and the participant expression that emitted the workitem to them is stuck waiting. Or simply the engine could have been down when the participant answer came and the answer got lost.

With a @re_apply@, it's possible to re-apply the delivery and hopefully restart the interaction (though that could ultimately depend on the participant implementation).

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
    sequence do
      alpha
      bravo
    end
  end

  wfid = engine.launch(pdef)

  # ... process stalls at participant alpha ...

  stalled_fexp = engine.process(wfid).expressions.last
    #
    # expressions in process status (as returned by Engine#process) are
    # ordered with the root as the first and the leaves in the last positions

  engine.re_apply(stalled_fexp.fei)
    #
    # will cancel the expression at 'alpha' and re_apply it, triggering
    # a new dispatch to the participant alpha points to.
</pre>


h4(#re_applying_tree). re_applying a process branch that went wrong

If a process branch went wrong, it's sometimes necessary to redo it.

Some process developers like to include those "something went wrong" paths as extension to the happy path and they use the "@cursor@":exp/cursor.html expression with some @rewind@ magic. But sometimes it's really necessary to rewind/redo manually.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'yajl'
require 'ruote'

engine = Ruote::Engine.new(Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new))

pdef = Ruote.define do
  sequence do
    alpha
    bravo
    zebulon
  end
end

class ThisParticipant
  include Ruote::LocalParticipant
  def consume(workitem)
    puts "* #{workitem.participant_name}"
    reply_to_engine(workitem)
  end
end
class ThatParticipant
  include Ruote::LocalParticipant
  def consume(workitem)
    puts ". #{workitem.participant_name}"
    # no reply to engine
  end
  def cancel (fei, flavour)
    # ok, let pass
  end
  def do_not_thread; true; end
end

engine.register_participant 'alpha', ThisParticipant
engine.register_participant 'bravo', ThisParticipant
engine.register_participant 'charlie', ThisParticipant
engine.register_participant 'zebulon', ThatParticipant

#engine.context.logger.noisy = true

wfid = engine.launch(pdef)

engine.wait_for(:zebulon)

# ... process reached 'zebulon', but there something wrong
#     we need to redo that sequence differently ...

ps = engine.process(wfid)

sequence = ps.expressions.find { |fexp| fexp.fei.expid == '0_0' }
  # first child '0' after the root '0' => '0_0'

puts "re_applying..."

engine.re_apply(sequence.fei, :tree => Ruote.to_tree do
  sequence do
    charlie
    bravo
    alpha
  end
end)

engine.wait_for(wfid)
</pre>
(gist at "http://gist.github.com/485559":http://gist.github.com/485559)

This self-containing example will output:

<pre class="brush: jscript">
* alpha
* bravo
. zebulon
re_applying...
* charlie
* bravo
* alpha
</pre>

The key here is the @:tree@ option passed to re_apply, it gives that has to be applied instead of the target expression.


h4(#re_applying_fields). re_applying and changing the [workitem] fields

When re_applying, the workitem used for the @re_apply@ is the one used to originally apply.

The re_apply method accepts the @:fields@ and @:merge_in_fields@ options. @:fields@ completely changes the workitem payload used for the @re_apply@, while the @:merge_in_fields@, allows to add new fields to the workitem payload.

A few examples:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
engine.re_apply(fei, :fields => { 'customer' => 'Alfred' })

engine.re_apply(fei, :merge_in_fields => { 'customer' => 'Alfred' })

engine.re_apply(
  fei,
  :fields => { 'customer' => 'Alfred', 'items' => [ 124, 356, 798 ] },
  :tree => Ruote.to_tree { sequence { print_invoice; package; ship } })
</pre>

&nbsp;

***

h3(#errors). process errors

Each time a process encounters an error (most likely in a participant implementation), the process stops and 'documents' the error.

If a process is in two concurrent branches, only the execution of the branch with the error will stop. A process instance can have as many errors has it has concurrent branches.

Here is a program that runs a process with a unreliable participant:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'ruote'

class TestParticipant
  include Ruote::LocalParticipant

  def consume(workitem)
    raise "Houston, something is wrong"
  end
end

engine = Ruote::Engine.new(Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new))

engine.register do
  catchall TestParticipant
end

pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
  bad
end

wfid = engine.launch(pdef)

engine.wait_for(wfid)
  # blocks until the process terminates or gets into an error

err = engine.process(wfid).errors.first
puts "intercepted an error: #{err.message}..."
</pre>

It's possible to query the engine about the status of a process instance and its errors.

Once a process got into an error, there are 3 possibilities:

* "cancel":#errors_cancel_whole_process the whole process
* "cancel the branch":#errors_cancel of the process that is in error
* fix the cause and "replay":#errors_replay at the error

plus one that has to be prepared in advance:

* having acknowledged that such an error might occur, set an "@:on_error@":#errors_on_error attribute on the branch where the error might occur

Which possibility to use depends on your process and context.


h4(#errors_cancel_whole_process). errors: cancelling the whole process

The car won't start ? Let's dump it.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.cancel_process(wfid)
</pre>


h4(#errors_cancel). errors: cancelling

First variant, cancelling at the error point:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  ps = engine.process(wfid)
  engine.cancel_expression(ps.errors.first.fei)
</pre>

This will make the flow resume right after the expression in error.

Second variant, cancelling upstream. It sounds nice but it actually requires knowledge of the process definition.

Consider this process definition:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition do
    concurrence do
      alpha
      bravo
      sequence do
        charly
        delta
      end
    end
  end
</pre>

If an error occurred at @charly@, you could cancel at @charly@ directly, or the sequence, or the concurrence.

Without looking at the process definition and knowing the participants involved, it's hard to cancel "upstreams".

This alpha-bravo-charly example is expanded at "https://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/blob/ruote2.1/snips/where_to_cancel.rb":https://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/blob/ruote2.1/snips/where_to_cancel.rb


h4(#errors_replay). errors: replaying

Launching a process, intercepting the error, fixing its cause and replaying:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'ruote'

$mode = :fail

class TestParticipant
  include Ruote::LocalParticipant

  def consume(workitem)
    raise "Houston, something is wrong" if $mode == :fail
    reply_to_engine(workitem)
  end
end

engine = Ruote::Engine.new(Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new))

engine.register do
  catchall TestParticipant
end

pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
  bad
end

wfid = engine.launch(pdef)

engine.wait_for(wfid)

err = engine.process(wfid).errors.first
puts "intercepted an error: #{err.message}... fixing..."

$mode = :success
  # fixing the cause of the error

engine.replay_at_error(err)

engine.wait_for(wfid)

p engine.process(wfid)
  # => nil (the process is over)
</pre>


h4(#errors_on_error). on_error

The "@:on_error@ attribute":http://localhost:4331/common_attributes.html#on_error is explained in the "common attributes" page.

(isn't prevention of errors better than dealing with them automatically ?)
